                    Ahhh... The classic die and ressurect in a different world experience, the idea is nice and all but its also highly overused with animes where the main character comes back as a fridge or something like that (kinda weird not gonna lie)  
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are on the other side, very good animes with this theme, I'll list below my top 3 animes of this genre:

                    <li>Konosuba</li>
                    <li>No game no life</li>
                    <li>Angel Beats</li>
                </ul>

                    Yes, you didn't read wrong, Angel Beats is a isekai anime that will dehydrate you from how much it will make you cry :D

                <p>Romance is a genre that is as old as the planet, and if there is something that is present in every single anime is romace, but not all of them can do a good job as the ones on this list below.</p>
                <p>even tho romance can be portrait in every show, manga, animes, they are usually bad represented so why not check the ones I personally think are the best one on show real romance</p>

                <header>shoujo</header>
                <p>Shoujo is well-known as being a genre made for Girls, but thats not at all true, shoujos usually have a female as the main characters and usually portrait the character love life or romantic interactions</p>
                <p>But over the years more and more woman start showing up on the manga scene, bringing new visions on the same subject, and also giving more profundity to everything around this topic  </p>
                <p>Here I'll leave 3 mangas that I absolutly love on this genre</p>

                <p>Reading different stories bring us all a lot of different emotions, and one that is very common to see inside all  mangas and animes is comedy, its always good to have a great laught after being thorned apart from a sad moment of a story</p>
                <p>Here I'll list 3 animes that made me laugh so much my cheeks still hurting</p>

                <p>This is by far my most precious and beloved genre, stories that tell a slice of the life of the characters, showing their life, their toughts and their way of living life</p>
                <p>Sometimes, do the simple surpass complexty</p>
